# react-native Buyscreen sample

Based on [react-native framework](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/) (as of 0.3.4) by Facebook.

Customizable buy-screen for displaying products for user to purchase. Have links to native code in order to process transactions and load actual products configuration (e.g. if loaded from backend).

Current version (with real StoreKit integration) will be used in [App in the Air](https://www.appintheair.mobi).

### Components
Was built using framework provided components:
* `Line` — simple line
* [`Carousel`](https://github.com/appintheair/react-native-looped-carousel) — scroll view which its contents in loop and allows the user to change pages
* `FilledButton` — button with round corners
* `HUDActivityIndicator` — simple [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD)-inspired activity indicator
